Dataset we used.. 
We made an interactive dashboard on Olympic dataset ranging from 1860 to 2016 where we tried to make sense of the data by presenting them with different matrices and plots.
What we did?
As we said earlier,We tried to convert Olympic dataset into a coherent insight.We Used different cards,bar plots and matrices to present out data.We used cards to present the total medals won till 2016 in Olympic games.We bifurcated the data into winter and summer Olympics by using interactive cards,which will tell you the data according to the option you have clicked.
We also added an interactive slider which will take you to different years of Olympic games and provide you information accordingly.
We used bar plots to represent Country wise distribution of Olympic medals.
